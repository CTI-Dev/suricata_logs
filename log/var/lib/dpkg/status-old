Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: GNU Bourne Again SHell
 Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
 commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
 incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
 .
 Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
 IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
 .
 The Programmable Completion Code, by Ian Macdonald, is now found in
 the bash-completion package.

Description: programmable completion for the bash shell
 bash completion extends bash's standard completion behavior to achieve
 complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.  This project was
 conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most
 common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins
 and programmers need to do on a daily basis.

 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this

 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: Versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol
 It consists of a pair of programs:
 .
 chronyd:  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.
 It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.
 .
 chronyc: This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within
 the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

Description: initialization system for infrastructure cloud instances
 Cloud-init provides a framework and tool to configure and customize virtual
 machine instances for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds platforms. It
 can for example set a default locale and hostname, generate SSH private host
 keys, install SSH public keys for logging into a default account, set up
 ephemeral mount points, and run user-provided scripts.
 .
 Various methods are supported for passing data to the instance at launch
 time, including the standard interfaces of multiple platforms.

Description: automatically resize the root partition on first boot
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed, the initramfs will repartition a disk to make the
 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.
 In this case, with this package installed, you can automatically use
 the new space without requiring a reboot to re-read the partition table.

Description: open and reliable container runtime
 Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for
 Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container life cycle of
 its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and
 supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.
 .
 Containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than
 being used directly by developers or end-users.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: GNU privacy guard - network certificate management service
 dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading OpenPGP and X.509
 certificates, as well as updates and status signals related to those
 certificates.  For OpenPGP, this means pulling from the public
 HKP/HKPS keyservers, or from LDAP servers.  For X.509 this includes
 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status
 Protocol updates (OCSP).  It is capable of using Tor for network
 access.
 .
 dirmngr is used for network access by gpg, gpgsm, and dirmngr-client,
 among other tools.  Unless this package is installed, the parts of
 the GnuPG suite that try to interact with the network will fail.

Description: SMBIOS/DMI table decoder
 Dmidecode reports information about the system's hardware as described in the
 system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard.
 .
 This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial
 number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying
 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will
 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

Description: Linux container runtime
 Docker complements kernel namespacing with a high-level API which operates at
 the process level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees of isolation
 and repeatability across servers.
 .
 Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems:
 large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment systems,
 private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and client. Using docker.io on non-amd64 hosts
 is not supported at this time. Please be careful when using it on anything
 besides amd64.
 .
 Also, note that kernel version 3.8 or above is required for proper operation of
 the daemon process, and that any lower versions may have subtle and/or glaring
 issues.

Description: ext2/ext3/ext4 file system utilities
 The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
 ("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for
 hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains programs for creating, checking, and maintaining
 ext2/3/4-based file systems.  It also includes the "badblocks" program,
 which can be used to scan for bad blocks on a disk or other storage device.

 This program will eject CD-ROMs (assuming your drive supports the CDROMEJECT
 ioctl). It also allows setting the autoeject feature.
 .
 On supported ATAPI/IDE multi-disc CD-ROM changers, it allows changing
 the active disc.
 .
 You can also use eject to properly disconnect external mass-storage
 devices like digital cameras or portable music players.

Description: tools to create, check and label exFAT filesystems
 Tools to manage extended file allocation table filesystem.
 This package provides tools to create, check and label the
 filesystem. It contains
  - mkfs.exfat to create an exFAT filesystem
  - fsck.exfat to check and repair an exFAT filesystem
  - tune.exfat to print and edit the filesystem label
 The tools included in this package are the exfatprogs
 maintained by Samsung engineers, who provided Linux exFAT
 support. A similar but independent implementation of these
 tools, written by the author of the exfat-fuse implementation,
 are available in the exfat-utils package.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You
 can find the subscription web page on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-exim4-users

Description: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
 Fail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans
 failure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban
 allows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to ban
 an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a notification
 email.
 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, apache, proftpd, sasl, etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.  Following recommends
 are listed:
 .
  - iptables/nftables -- default installation uses iptables for banning.
    nftables is also supported. You most probably need it
  - whois -- used by a number of *mail-whois* actions to send notification
    emails with whois information about attacker hosts. Unless you will use
    those you don't need whois
  - python3-pyinotify -- unless you monitor services logs via systemd, you
    need pyinotify for efficient monitoring for log files changes

 fakeroot provides a fake "root environment" by means of LD_PRELOAD and
 SysV IPC (or TCP) trickery. It puts wrappers around getuid(), chown(),
 stat(), and other file-manipulation functions, so that unprivileged
 users can (for instance) populate .deb archives with root-owned files;
 various build tools use fakeroot for this by default.

Description: Make large character ASCII banners out of ordinary text
 FIGlet (Frank, Ian & Glenn's Letters) is a program that creates large
 characters out of ordinary screen characters.
 .
 It can create characters in many different styles and can
 kern and "smush" these characters together in various ways.  FIGlet
 output is generally reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people
 like to put at the end of e-mail, Usenet and MOTD messages.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package only contains the sans, sans-bold, serif, serif-bold,
 mono and mono-bold variants. For additional variants, see the
 fonts-dejavu-extra package.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.

Description: GNU privacy guard - cryptographic agent
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC4880.
 .
 This package contains the agent program gpg-agent which handles all
 secret key material for OpenPGP and S/MIME use.  The agent also
 provides a passphrase cache, which is used by pre-2.1 versions of
 GnuPG for OpenPGP operations.  Without this package, trying to do
 secret-key operations with any part of the modern GnuPG suite will
 fail.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Linux entropy source using the HAVEGE algorithm
 haveged is a userspace entropy daemon which is not dependent upon the
 standard mechanisms for harvesting randomness for the system entropy
 pool. This is important in systems with high entropy needs or limited
 user interaction (e.g. headless servers).
 .
 haveged uses HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion)
 to maintain a 1M pool of random bytes used to fill /dev/random
 whenever the supply of random bits in dev/random falls below the low
 water mark of the device.
 .
 More information about HAVEGE is available at

 .
 Debian version also can recognize encoding of documents, do on-fly
 input and output recoding.
 .
 html2text was written because the author wasn't happy with the
 output of "lynx -dump" and so he wrote something better.

 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

Description: Library to access AppStream services
 AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to
 provide information about themselves to automated systems and end-users
 before the software is actually installed.
 This permits informative displays of new applications to users in software
 centers, as well as allowing a system to make decisions on which new software
 a user might want to install (e.g. missing firmware or media handlers).
 .
 This package contains a GObject-based library to access AppStream
 services, like the software component metadata pool.
 It also contains functions for reading, writing and transforming AppStream
 metadata.

Description: memory-hard hashing function - runtime library
 Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords
 for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
 .
 There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.
 Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides
 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

 Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm
 that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant
 of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling,
 with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
 general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
 deflate but offers more dense compression.

Description: library for common operations with sizes in bytes
 Many projects need to work with sizes in bytes (be it sizes of storage
 space, memory,...) and all of them need to deal with the same issues
 like:
 .
  * How to get a human-readable string for the given size?
  * How to store the given size so that no significant information is lost?
  * If we store the size in bytes, what if the given size gets over the
    MAXUINT64 value?  How to interpret sizes entered by users according
    to their locale and typing conventions?
  * How to deal with the decimal/binary units (MB vs. MiB) ambiguity?
 .
 This library aims to be as much generally usable as possible, small, fast and
 be easily interfaced from other languages.

 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: Perl module to help dump data structures
 Data::Dump provides a single function called dump that takes a list of values
 as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl
 code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The
 string is formatted for easy reading.
 .
 If called in void context, the dump is printed on standard error instead of
 being returned. If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's
 not-so-useful builtin, then you can also import the same function as "pp"
 (the mnemonic for "pretty-print").

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Depends: perl:any
Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description: XML parsing C library - development kit
 This package contains the header file and development libraries of
 expat, the C library for parsing XML.  Expat is a stream oriented XML
 parser.  This means that you register handlers with the parser prior
 to starting the parse.  These handlers are called when the parser
 discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed.  A
 start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
 register handlers.

 be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
 representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.
 .
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed.
 .
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

Description: Frame Streams (fstrm) library
 Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
 transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
 overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
 encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
 format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
 MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
 transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
 AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
 at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
 over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
 how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
 .
 This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: collection of modules that parse HTML text documents
 HTML::Parser is a collection of modules useful for handling HTML documents.
 These modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
 unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.
 .
 Objects of the HTML::Parser class will recognize markup and separate it from
 content data. As different kinds of markup are recognized, the corresponding
 event handler is invoked. The document to be parsed may also be supplied in
 arbitrary chunks, making on-the-fly parsing of network documents possible.

Description: HTTP cookie jars
 This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is, a
 database of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows
 about.
 .
 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Description: perl interface to HTTP style messages
 The HTTP::Message distribution contains classes useful for representing the

 The HTTP::Headers class encapsulates HTTP-style message headers. The headers
 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.
 .
 Instances of this class are usually created as member variables of the
 HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response classes, internal to the library.

 The Public Suffix List is a cross-vendor initiative to provide an accurate
 list of domain name suffixes. A "public suffix" is one under which Internet
 users can directly register names. Some examples of public suffixes are
 ".com", ".co.uk" and "pvt.k12.wy.us". The Public Suffix List is a list of all
 known public suffixes.

Description: JavaScript's functional programming helper library
 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.

 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

Description: library for communication with `teamd` process
 libteamdctl is a library for communication with teamd process
 (via D-Bus, Unix socket or zeromq). It is used by the `teamdctl` utility.
 .
 Libteam provides a mechanism to team multiple NICs (ports) at OSI Layer 2
 (Data link) into a single virtual NIC. The process is called "channel
 bonding", "Ethernet bonding", "channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc.
 This is already implemented in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver but
 unlike the bonding driver, libteam (user space) has the following
 additional features:
  * load-balancing for LACP support
  * NS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring
  * port priorities and stickiness ("primary" option enhancement)
  * separate per-port link monitoring setup
 .
 Libteam requires Linux kernel 3.3 or higher.

Description: perl module for simple terminal control
 Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
 control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.) support for
 non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized handy
 functions for working with terminals. One of the main goals is to have the
 functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in "use
 Term::ReadKey" on any architecture and have a good likelihood of it working.

Description: library for processing keyboard input
 This library allows easy processing of keyboard entry from terminal-based
 programs. It handles all the necessary logic to recognise special keys, UTF-8
 combining, and so on, with a simple interface.  It provides the following
 features:
 .
  * Follows terminfo for every sequence listed there, only falling back on
    other methods to deal with unrecognised input.
  * Recognises special keys (such as arrow and function keys), including
    "modified" keys like Ctrl-Left.
  * Recognises XTerm-style mouse position/button reporting.
  * MIT licenced to allow almost all projects to use it; both Open Source
    and Commercial.
  * Small API - just three functions are needed in simple common cases.
  * Both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) APIs are
    supported.

Description: abstract terminal library
 An abstract C99 library which implements a VT220 or xterm-like terminal
 emulator. It doesn't use any particular graphics toolkit or output
 system, instead it invokes callback function pointers that its embedding
 program should provide it to draw on its behalf. It avoids calling
 malloc() during normal running state, allowing it to be used in embedded
 kernel situations.

 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 The XML::Twig module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Description: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description: utility for directing compilation
 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

Description: Pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: view multiple logfiles windowed on console
 multitail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail
 program.
 .
 The difference is that this program creates multiple windows on
 your console (with ncurses). It can also use colors while displaying the
 logfiles for faster recognizing which lines are important and which are
 not.
 .
 It is optimized for terminal-sessions through slow links.

Description: small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico
 GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
 for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
 (itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).
 .
 However, GNU nano also implements many features missing in Pico, including:
  - undo/redo
  - line numbering
  - syntax coloring
  - soft-wrapping of overlong lines
  - selecting text by holding Shift
  - interactive search and replace (with regular expression support)
  - a go-to line (and column) command
  - support for multiple file buffers
  - auto-indentation
  - tab completion of filenames and search terms
  - toggling features while running
  - and full internationalization support

 This module executes a task after the scheduled tasks are over

 ASAP strives to schedule events to occur before yielding for IO, reflow, or

 is empty before yielding to the JavaScript engine's underlying event-loop.
 When a task gets added to a previously empty event queue, ASAP schedules a
 flush event, preferring for that event to occur before the JavaScript engine
 has an opportunity to perform IO tasks or rendering, thus making the first
 task and subsequent tasks semantically indistinguishable. ASAP uses a
 variety of techniques to preserve this invariant on different versions of
 browsers and Node.js

 This module provides an http.Agent implementation that connects to a specified
 HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in 'https' module.
 .
 Specifically, this 'Agent' implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
 server and issues the CONNECT, which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP
 connection to the destination server.
 .
 Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
 protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).

 This module is an incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit)
 hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on Gary Court's implementation with
 kazuyukitanimura's modifications.
 .
 This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if
 you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string
 concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version)
 is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about
 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Description: Safely pass strings through shells - Node.js module
 A Node.js module that provides a simple and platform-agnostic way
 to build shell commands with arguments that pass through your shell
 unaltered and with no unsafe side effects, whether you are running
 on Windows or a Unix-based OS.
 .
 It is useful when launching a child process from Node.js using a shell
 (as with child_process.exec); in that case you have to construct your
 command as a single string instead of using an array of arguments.
 And doing that can be buggy (if not dangerous) if you don't take care
 to quote any arguments correctly for the shell you're targeting, and
 the quoting has to be done differently on Windows and non-Windows shells.

 wcwidth() and its string version, wcswidth() are defined by
 IEEE Std 1002.1-2001, a.k.a. POSIX.1-2001, and return the
 number of columns used to represent a wide character and
 string on fixed-width output devices like terminals.
 Markus's implementation assumes wide characters to be
 encoded in ISO 10646, which is almost true for JavaScript;
 almost because JavaScript uses UCS-2 and has problems
 with surrogate pairs. wcwidth.js converts surrogate pairs
 to Unicode code points to handle them correctly.

Description: package manager for Node.js
 Node.js is an event-based server-side javascript engine.
 .
 npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts
 modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
 conflicts intelligently.
 .
 It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases.
 Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop
 node programs.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: Provides a package management service
 PackageKit allows performing simple software management tasks over a DBus
 interface e.g. refreshing the cache, updating, installing and removing
 software packages or searching for multimedia codecs and file handlers.
 .
 The work is done by backends which make use of the package manager shipped by
 the corresponding distribution. PackageKit is not meant to replace
 advanced tools like Synaptic.
 .
 The main benefits are:
  - unified interface on several distributions
  - fine grained privileges by using PolicyKit
  - independency from a running desktop session during the processing

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.

 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.32' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.32') instead.

Description: version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages
 A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface
 to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are
 linked against different versions of OpenSSL.
 .
 This package provides a virtual package "perl-openssl-abi-x" that
 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.
 .
 Tools are also provided for generating this dependency with minimum
 hassle. See the instructions in README.Debian.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django

 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.

Description: reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with many mail user agents.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 Bug reporting in Debian relies on email; reportbug can use a local
 mail transport agent (like exim or sendmail), submit directly through
 an external mail server, or pass messages to an installed mail user
 agent (e.g., mutt) for submission.
 .
 This package also includes the "querybts" script for browsing the
 Debian bug tracking system.

Description: name server information handler
 Resolvconf is a framework for keeping up to date the system's
 information about name servers. It sets itself up as the intermediary
 between programs that supply this information (such as ifup and
 ifdown, DHCP clients, the PPP daemon and local name servers) and
 programs that use this information (such as DNS caches and resolver
 libraries).
 .
 This package may require some manual configuration. Please

 UDP, TCP, SSL). It provides forking, logging and tracing, different
 modes for interprocess communication and many more options.
 .
 It can be used, for example, as a TCP relay (one-shot or daemon),
 as an external socksifier, as a shell interface to Unix sockets,
 as an IPv6 relay, as a netcat and rinetd replacement, to redirect
 TCP-oriented programs to a serial line, or to establish a relatively
 secure environment (su and chroot) for running client or server shell
 scripts inside network connections. Socat supports sctp as of 1.7.0.

Description: Non-interactive ssh password authentication
 SSH's (secure shell) most common authentication mode is called "interactive
 keyboard password authentication", so called both because it is typically
 done via keyboard, and because openssh takes active measures to make sure
 that the password is, indeed, typed interactively by the keyboard. Sometimes,
 however, it is necessary to fool ssh into accepting an interactive password
 non-interactively. This is where sshpass comes in.
 .
 SECURITY NOTE: There is a reason openssh insists that passwords be typed
 interactively. Passwords are harder to store securely and to pass around
 securely between programs. If you have not looked into solving your needs
 using SSH's "public key authentication", perhaps in conjunction with the ssh
 agent (RTFM ssh-add), please do so before being tempted into using this
 package.

 and holds a number of sessions, each of which may have a number of
 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act

 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.

 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".

Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique
 IDs (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique within the space
 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUIDs, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of
 large numbers of threads trying to grab UUIDs running on different CPUs.
 It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen program.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
