Package: apksigner
Description-md5: 084b3acff7be60dc94f8caedfe355b64
Description-en: command line tool to sign and verify Android APKs
 apksig is a project which aims to simplify APK signing and checking
 whether APK's signatures should verify on Android. apksig supports
 JAR signing (used by Android since day one) and APK Signature Scheme
 v2 (supported since Android Nougat, API Level 24).
 .
 The key feature of apksig is that it knows about differences in APK
 signature verification logic between different versions of the
 Android platform. apksig can thus check whether a signed APK is
 expected to verify on all Android platform versions supported by the
 APK. When signing an APK, apksig will choose the most appropriate
 cryptographic algorithms based on the Android platform versions
 supported by the APK being signed.
 .
 apksigner command-line tool offers two operations:
 .
  * sign the provided APK so that it verifies on all Android platforms
 supported by the APK. Run apksigner sign for usage information.
 .
  * check whether the provided APK's signatures are expected to verify
 on all Android platforms supported by the APK. Run apksigner verify
 for usage information.
 .
 The tool determines the range of Android platform versions (API
 Levels) supported by the APK by inspecting the APK's
 AndroidManifest.xml. This behavior can be overridden by specifying
 the range of platform versions on the command-line.

 .
 apksig library offers three primitives:
 .
  * ApkSigner which signs the provided APK so that it verifies on all
 Android platform versions supported by the APK. The range of platform
 versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * ApkVerifier which checks whether the provided APK is expected to
 verify on all Android platform versions supported by the APK. The
 range of platform versions can be customized if necessary.
 .
  * (Default)ApkSignerEngine which abstracts away signing an APK from
 parsing and building an APK file. This is useful in optimized APK
 building pipelines, such as in Android Plugin for Gradle, which need
 to perform signing while building an APK, instead of after. For
 simpler use cases where the APK to be signed is available upfront,
 the ApkSigner above is easier to use.
 .

Package: apt-cacher-ng
Description-md5: b88e5e2d04c76e8d4500fb60880c7d76
Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

  * Containers support stateful allocators and are compatible with
    Boost.Interprocess (they can be safely placed in shared memory).
  * The library offers new useful containers:
    * flat_map, flat_set, flat_multimap and flat_multiset: drop-in
      replacements for standard associative containers but more
      memory friendly and with faster searches.
    * stable_vector: a std::list and std::vector hybrid container:
      vector-like random-access iterators and list-like iterator
      stability in insertions and erasures.
    * slist: the classic pre-standard singly linked list implementation
      offering constant-time size(). Note that C++11 forward_list has no size().

 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)

 library.
 .
 Each fiber has its own stack.
 .
 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.

Description-en: deduplicating and compressing backup program
 Borg is a deduplicating and compressing backup program. Optionally, it
 also supports authenticated encryption. It was forked from the attic
 backup program.
 .
 The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
 backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
 for daily backups since only the changes are stored. The authenticated
 encryption makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted targets.
 .
 It can push backups to remote repositories accessed via ssh. A client
 pushing a backup invokes "borg serve" on the repository host. It is
 possible to restrict the ssh key to "borg serve" using the
 authorized_keys command= clause.
 .
 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.
 .
 While there is no direct operations mode for pull-type backups, you
 can configure the backup target in append-only mode, preventing the
 backup source from deleting or altering previous backups.

Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using rawspeed, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

 into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into.

Package: detox
Description-md5: 57a56ea30e81ef29e23165136cbfe243
Description-en: replace problematic characters in filenames
 detox is a utility designed to clean up filenames. It replaces difficult to
 work with characters, such as spaces, with standard equivalents. It will also
 clean up filenames with UTF-8 or Latin-1 (or CP-1252) characters in them.
 .
 Features:
  * Removal or replacement of upper ASCII Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters;
  * Removal or replacement of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters;
  * Removal or replacement of spaces and other potentially tricky characters;
  * Trimming of excessive "_" and "-"s;
  * Directory recursion, dry runs, verbose listings.
 .
 It is designed with safety in mind. It won't overwrite a file that already
 exists, and it doesn't touch special files if not requested.
 .
 detox is useful to mass rename files automatically. As just one example,
 you can use detox to easily standardize lots of files, as MP3 or movies,
 downloaded or stored inside a directory.
 .
 This package provides detox and inline-detox commands. The inline-detox can
 be used in command lines, as a filter in shell procedures.

Package: devscripts
Description-md5: 7a21e8d1d7391fcfb661ad2b20cd9776
Description-en: scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier
 Contains the following scripts, dependencies/recommendations shown in
 brackets afterwards:
 .
  - annotate-output: run a command and prepend time and stream (O for stdout,
    E for stderr) for every line of output.
  - archpath: Prints arch (tla/Bazaar 1.x) package names. Also supports
    calculating the package names for other branches. [tla]
  - bts: A command-line tool for accessing the Debian Bug Tracking System, both
    to send mails to control@bts.debian.org and to access the web pages and
    SOAP interface of the BTS. [www-browser, libauthen-sasl-perl,
    libnet-smtps-perl, libsoap-lite-perl, liburi-perl, libwww-perl,
    bsd-mailx | mailx]
  - build-rdeps: Searches for all packages that build-depend on a given package.
    [dctrl-tools, dose-extra, libdpkg-perl]
  - chdist: tool to easily play with several distributions. [dctrl-tools]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific constructs.
  - cowpoke: upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it,
    optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.
    [ssh-client]
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrappers around debi and debc respectively (see below)
    which allow them to be called from the CVS working directory.
    [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: wrapper around debrelease which allows it to be called
    from the CVS working directory. [cvs-buildpackage, dupload | dput,
    ssh-client]
  - cvs-debuild: A wrapper for cvs-buildpackage to use debuild as its package
    building program. [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian, gnupg |gnupg2]
  - dcmd: run a given command replacing the name of a .changes or .dsc file
    with each of the files referenced therein. *
  - dd-list: given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer. *
  - debbisect: bisect snapshot.debian.org to find which change in the archive
    introduced a certain problem. [mmdebstrap, python3-debian]
  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary.
    [fakeroot]*
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports
    tagging Debian package releases. [cvs | darcs | subversion | svk | tla |
    bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]
  - debdiff: A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and
    reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring
    that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.  Can also examine
    two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.
    For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package.
    [wdiff, patchutils]*
  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that
    changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to check
    that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]
  - debi: Installs the current package by using the setuid root debpkg
    script described below.  It assumes that the current package has
    just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb lives in the
    parent directory, and will effectively run dpkg -i on the .deb.  The
    ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debootsnap: Combines debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot
    containing exactly the requested selection of packages. This can be used
    to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to reproduce a bug. The
    tool is also used by debrebuild to build a package in a chroot with build
    dependencies in the same version as recorded in the buildinfo file.
    [python3-pycurl, mmdebstrap]
  - debpkg: A wrapper for dpkg used by debi to allow convenient testing
    of packages.  For debpkg to work, it needs to be made setuid root,
    and this needs to be performed by the sysadmin -- it is not
    installed as setuid root by default.  (Note that being able to run a
    setuid root debpkg is effectively the same as having root access to
    the system, so this should be done with caution.)  Having debpkg as
    a wrapper for dpkg can be a Good Thing (TM), as it decreases the
    potential for damage by accidental wrong use of commands in
    superuser mode (e.g., an inadvertent rm -rf * in the wrong directory
    is disastrous as many can attest to).
  - debrelease: A wrapper around dupload or dput which figures out which
    version to upload, and then calls dupload or dput to actually perform
    the upload. [dupload | dput, ssh-client]
  - debrebuild: A script that provided a .buildinfo file reports the
    instructions on how to try to reproduce the reported build.
    [sbuild | mmdebstrap, python3-pycurl, libdpkg-perl]
  - debrepro: A script that tests reproducibility of Debian packages. It will
    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.
    [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]
  - debrsign: This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for
    signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection.
    [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring, ssh-client]
  - debsign: Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc)
    files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful
    if you are building a package on a remote machine and wish to sign it on
    a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the
    .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg |gnupg2,
    debian-keyring, ssh-client]*
  - debsnap: grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl,
    libjson-perl]
  - debuild: A wrapper for building a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to
    avoid problems with insufficient permissions and wrong paths etc.
    Debuild will set up the proper environment for building a package.
    Debuild will use the fakeroot program to build the package by default, but
    can be instructed to use any other gain-root command, or can even be
    installed setuid root.  Debuild can also be used to run various of
    the debian/rules operations with the same root-gaining procedure.
    Debuild will also run lintian to check that the package does not
    have any major policy violations. [fakeroot, lintian, gnupg | gnupg2]*
  - deb-janitor: command-line client for interacting with the Debian Janitor.
  - deb-reversion: increases a binary package version number and repacks the
    package, useful for porters and the like.
  - deb-why-removed: shows the reason a package was removed from the archive.
    [libdpkg-perl]
  - dep3changelog: generate a changelog entry from a DEP3-style patch header.
  - desktop2menu: given a freedesktop.org desktop file, generate a skeleton
    for a menu file. [libfile-desktopentry-perl]

    .dsc to download all references files. Specify a package name to download
    it from the configured apt repository. [wget | curl]
  - diff2patches: extracts patches from a .diff.gz file placing them under
    debian/ or, if present, debian/patches. [patchutils]
  - dpkg-depcheck, dpkg-genbuilddeps: Runs a specified command (such as

    packages used during the build process.  This information can be helpful
    when trying to determine the packages needed in the Build-Depends etc.
    lines in the debian/control file. [build-essential, strace]
  - dscextract: extract a single file from a Debian source package. [patchutils]
  - dscverify: check the signature and MD5 sums of a dsc file against the most
    current Debian keyring on your system. [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring]
  - edit-patch: add/edit a patch for a source package and commit the changes.
    [quilt | dpatch | cdbs]
  - getbuildlog: download package build logs from Debian auto-builders. [wget]

    [libdpkg-perl, libgit-wrapper-perl, liblist-compare-perl,
    libstring-shellquote-perl, libtry-tiny-perl]
  - grep-excuses: grep britney's excuses to find out what is happening to your
    packages. [libdbd-pg-perl, libterm-size-perl, libyaml-syck-perl, wget, w3m]
  - hardening-check: report the hardening characteristics of a set of binaries.
  - list-unreleased: searches for packages marked UNRELEASED in their
    changelog.
  - ltnu (Long Time No Upload): List all uploads of packages by the

    package which may be installed to satisfy the build-dependencies of the
    given package. [equivs]
  - mk-origtargz: Rename upstream tarball, optionally changing the compression
    and removing unwanted files.
    [libfile-which-perl, unzip, xz-utils, file]
  - namecheck: Check project names are not already taken.
  - nmudiff: prepare a diff of this version (presumably an NMU against the
    previously released version (as per the changelog) and submit the diff
    to the BTS. [patchutils, mutt]
  - origtargz: fetch the orig tarball of a Debian package from various sources,
    and unpack it. [pristine-tar, pristine-lfs]
  - plotchangelog: display information from a changelog graphically using
    gnuplot. [libtimedate-perl, gnuplot]

  - salsa: manipulates salsa.debian.org repositories and users
    [libgitlab-api-v4-perl]
  - suspicious-source: output a list of files which are not common source
    files. [python3-magic]
  - svnpath: Prints the path to the Subversion repository of a Subversion
    checkout. Also supports calculating the paths for branches and
    tags in a repository independent fashion. Used by debcommit to generate
    svn tags. [subversion]
  - tagpending: runs from a Debian source tree and tags bugs that are to be
    closed in the latest changelog as pending. [libsoap-lite-perl]
  - transition-check: Check a list of source packages for involvement in
    transitions for which uploads to unstable are currently blocked.
    [libwww-perl, libyaml-syck-perl]
  - uscan: Automatically scan for and download upstream updates.  Uscan can
    also call a program such as uupdate to attempt to update the Debianised
    version based on the new update.  Whilst uscan could be used to release
    the updated version automatically, it is probably better not to without
    testing it first.  Uscan can also verify detached OpenPGP signatures if
    upstream's signing key is known. [file, gpgv | gpgv2, gnupg | gnupg2,
    libfile-dirlist-perl, libfile-touch-perl, libfile-which-perl,
    liblwp-protocol-https-perl, libmoo-perl, libwww-perl, unzip, xz-utils]*
  - uupdate: Update the package with an archive or patches from

Package: dns-flood-detector
Description-md5: c9037957f94596c4ef075b80e4191ca3
Description-en: detect abusive usage levels on high traffic nameservers
 This package provides the dns-flood-detector daemon.
 .
 It was developed to detect abusive usage levels on high traffic nameservers
 and to enable quick response in halting the use of one's nameserver to
 facilitate spam.
 It uses libpcap (in non-promiscuous mode) to monitor incoming dns queries to a
 nameserver. The tool may be run in one of two modes, either daemon mode or
 "bindsnap" mode. In daemon mode, the tool will alarm via syslog. In bindsnap
 mode, the user is able to get near-real-time stats on usage to aid in more
 detailed troubleshooting.

Package: dnsmap
Description-md5: 8da238b788e263a0deb14cbebae67043
Description-en: DNS domain name brute forcing tool
 dnsmap scans a domain for common subdomains using a built-in or an external
 wordlist (if specified using -w option). The internal wordlist has around 1000
 words in English and Spanish as ns1, firewall servicios and smtp. So will be
 possible search for smtp.example.com inside example.com automatically. Results
 can be saved in CSV and human-readable format for further processing. dnsmap
 does NOT require root privileges to be run, and should NOT be run with such
 privileges for security reasons.
 .
 dnsmap was originally released back in 2006 and was inspired by the fictional
 story "The Thief No One Saw" by Paul Craig, which can be found in the book
 "Stealing the Network - How to 0wn the Box".
 .
 dnsmap is mainly meant to be used by pentesters during the information
 gathering/enumeration phase of infrastructure security assessments. During the
 enumeration stage, the security consultant would typically discover the target
 company's IP netblocks, domain names, phone numbers, etc.
 .
 Subdomain brute-forcing is another technique that should be used in the
 enumeration stage, as it's especially useful when other domain enumeration
 techniques such as zone transfers don't work (I rarely see zone transfers being
 publicly allowed these days by the way).
 .
 Fun things that can happen:
 .
   1) Finding interesting remote access servers
      (e.g.: https:://extranet.example.com).
   2) Finding badly configured and/or unpatched servers
      (e.g.: test.example.com).
   3) Finding new domain names which will allow you to map
      non-obvious/hard-to-find netblocks of your target organization
      (registry lookups - aka whois is your friend).
   4) Sometimes you find that some bruteforced subdomains resolve to internal IP
      addresses (RFC 1918). This is great as sometimes they are real up-to-date
      "A" records which means that it is possible to enumerate internal servers
      of a target organization from the Internet by only using standard DNS
      resolving (as opposed to zone transfers for instance).
   5) Discover embedded devices configured using Dynamic DNS services
      (e.g.: IP Cameras). This method is an alternative to finding devices via
      Google hacking techniques.
 .
 This package provides two possible commands: dnsmap and dnsmap-bulk.
 .
 This program is useful for pentesters, ethical hackers and forensics experts.
 It also can be used for security tests.

Package: dnsperf
Description-md5: 20069f0b64c636082713d1bf352d3819
Description-en: DNS Performance Testing Tool
 dnsperf gathers accurate latency and throughput metrics for the Domain Name
 Service (DNS). Network operators can benchmark their naming and addressing
 infrastructure. dnsperf "self-paces" the DNS query load to simulate network
 conditions.
 .
 resperf systematically increases the query rate and monitors the response
 rate to simulate caching DNS services.

Package: dnsproxy
Description-md5: 6da369a1a9ebbedee375a89b1253ceb5
Description-en: proxy for DNS queries
 dnsproxy forwards DNS queries to two previously configured nameservers:
 one for authoritative queries and another for recursive queries.
 The received answers are sent back to the client unchanged.
 No local caching is done.
 .
 Primary motivation for this project was the need to replace Bind servers with
 djbdns in an ISP environment. These servers get recursive queries from
 customers and authoritative queries from outside at the same IP address.
 Now it is possible to run dnscache and tinydns on the same machine with
 queries dispatched by dnsproxy.
 .
 Another possible scenario is a firewall where proxy queries should be
 forwarded to the real server in a DMZ.

 desktop. Those sets may overlap, and different versions of the same dotfiles
 can be deployed using different predefined profiles. Or you may have a main
 set of dotfiles for your everyday host and a subset you only need to deploy
 to temporary hosts (cloud VM etc.) that may be using a slightly different
 version of some of the dotfiles.

 Unlike existing initramfs's, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.  The initramfs has
 (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
 we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.

Package: erlang-luerl
Description-md5: ba0442956c0172294ab501db8dfd5616
Description-en: implementation of Lua in Erlang
 An experimental implementation of Lua 5.2 written solely in pure Erlang
 .
 When to use Luerl:
 .
 Fast Language Switch: Luerl should allow you to switch between Erlang and Lua
 incredibly fast, introducing a way to use very small bits of logic programmed
 in Lua, inside an Erlang application, with good performance.
 .
 Multicore: Luerl provides a way to transparently utilize multicores. The
 underlying Erlang VM takes care of the distribution.
 .
 Microprocesses: It should give you a Lua environment that allows you to
 effortlessly run tens of thousands of Lua processes in parallel, leveraging
 the famed microprocesses implementation of the Erlang VM. The empty Luerl
 State footprint will be yet smaller than the C Lua State footprint.
 .
 Forking Up: Because of the immutable nature of the Luerl VM, it becomes a
 natural operation to use the same Lua State as a starting point for multiple
 parallel calculations.
 .
 However, Luerl will generally run slower than a reasonable native Lua
 implementation. This is mainly due the emulation of mutable data on top of an
 immutable world. There is really no way around this. An alternative would be
 to implement a special Lua memory outside of the normal Erlang, but this would
 defeat the purpose of Luerl. It would instead be then more logical to connect
 to a native Lua.
 .
 Some valid use cases for Luerl are:
  * Lua code will be run only occasionally and it wouldn't be worth managing
    an extra language implementation in the application;
  * the Lua code chunks are small so the slower speed is weighed up by Luerl's
    faster interface;
  * the Lua code calculates and reads variables more than changing them;
  * the same Lua State is repeatedly used to 'fork up' as a basis for
    massively many parallel calculations, based on the same state;
  * it is easy to run multiple instances of Luerl which could better utilise
    multicores.

Package: erlang-p1-pkix
Description-md5: 17490bcd12287b68f22b6961bdae9b3c
Description-en: PKIX certificates management library for Erlang
 The idea of the library is to simplify certificates configuration in Erlang
 programs. Typically an Erlang program which needs certificates  (for HTTPS/
 MQTT/XMPP/etc) provides a bunch of options such as certfile,  chainfile,
 privkey, etc. The situation becomes even more complicated when a  server
 supports so called virtual domains because a program is typically  required to
 match a virtual domain with its certificate. If a user has plenty  of virtual
 domains it's quickly becoming a nightmare for them to configure all this.
 The complexity also leads to errors: a single configuration mistake and a
 program generates obscure log messages, unreadable Erlang tracebacks or,
 even worse, just silently ignores the errors.
 Fortunately, the large part of certificates configuration can be automated,
 reducing a user configuration to something as simple as:
 .
 certfiles:
   - /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/*.pem
 .
 The purpose of this library is to do this dirty job under the hood.

Package: erlang-p1-xmpp
Description-md5: b8c0f1b7110aa2c36d3a69bd6b85e659
Description-en: Erlang/Elixir XMPP parsing and serialization library
 This library provides comprehensive representation of XMPP elements as
 well as tools to work with them. Every such element is represented by an
 Erlang record. Most of the library's code is auto generated and thus
 considered to be bug free and efficient.
 .
 The approach is very similar to ASN.1, Google Protocol Buffers or Apache
 Thrift: an XML element is transformed into internal language structure
 (an Erlang record in this case) - the process known as "decoding". During
 decoding, validation is also performed, thus well-typed structures are
 generated, potentially decreasing bugs related to handcrafted parsing. A
 reverse process known as "encoding" is applied for transforming an
 Erlang record into an XML element.
 .
 This package should be used along with erlang-p1-xml, because it is
 only able to decode from and encode to structures generated by that
 library (that is, xmlel() elements).

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Package: flit
Description-md5: d5eb260f83d0d92fae17af6ae5cc460b
Description-en: simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI (PEP 517)
 Flit is a easy way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI. It tries to
 require less thought about packaging and help you avoid common mistakes.
 .
 Flit supports PEP 517 Python packaging and PEP 621 project metadata.
 .
 Make the easy things easy and the hard things possible is an old motto from
 the Perl community. Flit is entirely focused on the easy things part of that,
 and leaves the hard things up to other tools.
 .
 Specifically, the easy things are pure Python packages with no build steps
 (neither compiling C code, nor bundling Javascript, etc.). The vast majority
 of packages on PyPI are like this: plain Python code, with maybe some static
 data files like icons included.

 contains a library for creating history rewriting tools.  As such, users
 with specialized needs can leverage it to quickly create entirely new
 history rewriting tools.

    and drag your mouse. Pausing or making a turn selects the currently
 dragged item.
  * Turbo-Mode: You can also "draw" gestures while holding Ctrl, Shift, or
    Alt without having to press your mouse button! This is especially useful
 when you opened the menu with a shortcut involving such a modifier.

 primitives.  Read the docs at pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/edwards25519
 (https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/edwards25519).
 .
 The code is originally derived from Adam Langley's internal implementation
 in the Go standard library, and includes George Tankersley's performance
 improvements (https://golang.org/cl/71950). It was then further developed
 by Henry de Valence for use in ristretto255.
 .
 Most users don't need this package, and should instead use crypto/ed25519
 for signatures, golang.org/x/crypto/curve25519 for Diffie-Hellman,
 or github.com/gtank/ristretto255 for prime order group logic. However,
 for anyone currently using a fork of crypto/ed25519/internal/edwards25519
 or github.com/agl/edwards25519, this package should be a safer, faster,
 and more powerful alternative.

 Note: Ironwood is pre-alpha work-in-progress. There's no stable API,
 versioning, or expectation that any two commits will be compatible with
 each other. Also, it hasn't been audited by a security expert. While the

 makes it easy to write programs that are free from deadlocks, goroutine
 leaks, and many of the for loops over select statements that show up in
 boilerplate code. The down side is that the code needs to be written in
 an asynchronous style, which is not idiomatic to Go, so it can take some

Description-en: implementation of bitsets
 This package implements bitsets, a mapping between non-negative integers
 and boolean values.  It should be more efficient than map[uint] bool.
 .
 It provides methods for setting, clearing, flipping, and testing
 individual integers.
 .
 But it also provides set intersection, union, difference, complement,
 and symmetric operations, as well as tests to check whether any, all,
 or no bits are set, and querying a bitset's current length and number
 of positive bits.
 .
 BitSets are expanded to the size of the largest set bit; the memory
 allocation is approximately Max bits, where Max is the largest set
 bit. BitSets are never shrunk. On creation, a hint can be given for the
 number of bits that will be used.
 .
 Many of the methods, including Set, Clear, and Flip, return a BitSet
 pointer, which allows for chaining.

Package: golang-github-cli-oauth-dev
Description-md5: 0050910e61935f22aebdbf0973972960
Description-en: perform OAuth Device flow and Web application flow (Go library)
 github.com/cli/oauth is a library for Go client applications that need to
 perform OAuth authorization against a server, typically GitHub.com.
 .
 Traditionally, OAuth for web applications involves redirecting to
 a URI after the user authorizes an app.  While web apps (and some native
 client apps) can receive a browser redirect, client apps such as CLI
 applications do not have such an option.
 .
 To accommodate client apps, this library implements the OAuth Device
 Authorization Grant (https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/) which GitHub.com
 now supports.  With Device flow, the user is presented with a one-time code
 that they will have to enter in a web browser while authorizing the app on
 the server.  Device flow is suitable for cases where the web browser may be
 running on a separate device than the client app itself; for example
 a CLI application could run within a headless, containerized instance,
 but the user may complete authorization using a browser on their phone.
 .
 To transparently enable OAuth authorization on any GitHub host
 (e.g. GHES instances without OAuth "Device flow" support), this library
 also bundles an implementation of OAuth web application flow in which
 the client app starts a local server at http://127.0.0.1:<port>/
 that acts as a receiver for the browser redirect.  First, Device flow
 is attempted, and the localhost server is used as fallback.  With
 the localhost server, the user's web browser must be running on the
 same machine as the client application itself.

 .
 Structured logging is, basically, conceding to the reality that logs are data,
 and warrant some level of schematic rigor. Using a stricter,
 key/value-oriented message format for logs, containing contextual and semantic
 information, makes it much easier to get insight into the operational activity
 of the systems. Consequently, package log is of the strong belief that "the
 benefits of structured logging outweigh the minimal effort involved

Description-en: A fork of the golang built in log package to add support for levels (library)
 This package is a drop in replacement for the built-in Go log package.
 All the functionality of the built-in package still exists and is
 unchanged. In addition, this package contains a series of small
 enhancements and additions. Namely, it adds five logging levels.
 .
 In addition to these five defined logging levels, users can also define
 their own arbitrary logging levels.
 .
 Unlike other loggers, these logging levels are not enabled in a chain.
 Meaning, once a level is enabled, say Warn, all levels above it are not
 also enabled. This package is implemented in such a way that users can
 individually turn on and turn off the various new logging levels.
 However, starting with v1.3.0 users can enable logging in a chain buy
 enabling logging levels by number (see below). If existing code uses the
 build-in log package, no change is needed to use this package.
 .
 Another feature that was added, based on comments seen on the various
 golang boards, is the ability to set the calldepth.

Description-md5: a570016be8c1a78ee8634131254d0f7f
Description-en: Package for comparing Go values in tests
 This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to
 reflect.DeepEqual for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.
 .
 The primary features of cmp are:
  * When the default behavior of equality does not suit the needs of the test,
    custom equality functions can override the equality operation.  For
    example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as they
    are within some tolerance of each other.
  * Types that have an Equal method may use that method to determine equality.
    This allows package authors to determine the equality operation for the
    types that they define.
  * If no custom equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined,
    equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both
    values, much like reflect.DeepEqual. Unlike reflect.DeepEqual, unexported
    fields are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed
    by using an Ignore option (see cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported) or explicitly
    compared using the AllowUnexported option.
 .

Description-en: powerful URL router and dispatcher for golang
 Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
 .
 The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard
 http.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of
 registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL
 or other conditions. The main features are:
 .
  * Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes,
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
  * URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
  * Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining
    references to resources.
  * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the
    parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share
    common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes.
    As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
  * It implements the http.Handler interface so it is compatible with the
    standard http.ServeMux.

Description-en: better way to marshal and unmarshal YAML in Golang
 This package is a wrapper around go-yaml (gopkg.in/yaml.v3) designed to
 enable a better way of handling YAML when marshaling to and from structs.
 .
 This is a fork and split of the original github.com/ghodss/yaml
 repository which no longer appears to be maintained.
 .
 In short, this library first converts YAML to JSON using go-yaml and then
 uses json.Marshal and json.Unmarshal to convert to or from the struct.
 This means that it effectively reuses the JSON struct tags as well as
 the custom JSON methods MarshalJSON and UnmarshalJSON unlike go-yaml.

Description-en: library for decoding generic map values into native Go structures
 mapstructure is a Go library for decoding generic map values to structures and
 vice versa, while providing helpful error handling.
 .
 This library is most useful when decoding values from some data stream (JSON,
 Gob, etc.) where you don't quite know the structure of the underlying data
 until you read a part of it. You can therefore read a map[string]interface{}
 and use this library to decode it into the proper underlying native Go
 structure.
 .
 Go offers fantastic standard libraries for decoding formats such as JSON. The
 standard method is to have a struct pre-created, and populate that struct from
 the bytes of the encoded format. This is great, but the problem is if you have
 configuration or an encoding that changes slightly depending on specific
 fields.
 .
 Perhaps we can't populate a specific structure without first reading the "type"
 field from the JSON. We could always do two passes over the decoding of the
 JSON (reading the "type" first, and the rest later). However, it is much
 simpler to just decode this into a map[string]interface{} structure, read the
 "type" key, then use something like this library to decode it into the proper
 structure.

 go-toml v2 is a Go library for the TOML format.

 .
 Features:
 .
 Stdlib behavior
 As much as possible, this library is designed to behave similarly
 as the standard library's encoding/json.
 .
 Performance
 While go-toml favors usability, it is written with performance in mind.
 Most operations should not be shockingly slow.
 .
 Strict mode
 Decoder can be set to "strict mode", which makes it error when some parts
 of the TOML document was not prevent in the target structure.
 This is a great way to check for typos.
 .
 Contextualized errors
 When decoding errors occur, go-toml returns DecodeError), which contains
 a human readable contextualized version of the error.
 .
 Local date and time support
 TOML supports native local date/times. It allows to represent a given
 date, time, or date-time without relation to a timezone or offset.
 To support this use-case, go-toml provides LocalDate, LocalTime, and
 LocalDateTime. Those types can be transformed to and from time.Time,
 making them convenient yet unambiguous structures for their respective
 TOML representation.

Description-en: experimental and deprecated packages
 This subrepository holds experimental and deprecated (in the "old" directory)
 packages.
 .
 The idea for this subrepository originated as the "pkg/exp" directory of the
 main repository, but its presence there made it unavailable to users of the
 binary downloads of the Go installation. The subrepository has therefore been
 created to make it possible to "go get" these packages.
 .
 Warning: Packages here are experimental and unreliable. Some may one day be
 promoted to the main repository or other subrepository, or they may be modified
 arbitrarily or even disappear altogether.

 In short, code in this subrepository is not subject to the Go 1 compatibility
 promise. (No subrepo is, but the promise is even more likely to be violated by
 go.exp than the others.)

Package: golang-gopkg-yaml.v3-dev
Description-md5: 69dfb6cb659f3f6261cec62505cd521d
Description-en: YAML support for the Go language
 The yaml package enables Go programs to very comfortably encode and decode
 YAML values. It was developed within Canonical as part of the juju project,
 and is based on a pure Go port of the well-known libyaml C library to parse
 and generate YAML data quickly and reliably.
 .
 The yaml package supports most of YAML 1.2, but preserves some behavior from
 1.1 for backwards compatibility.
 .
 Specifically, as of v3 of the yaml package:
 .
  * YAML 1.1 bools (yes/no, on/off) are supported as long as they are being
    decoded into a typed bool value. Otherwise they behave as a string.
    Booleans in YAML 1.2 are true/false only.
  * Octals encode and decode as 0777 per YAML 1.1, rather than 0o777 as
    specified in YAML 1.2, because most parsers still use the old format.
    Octals in the 0o777 format are supported though, so new files work.
  * Does not support base-60 floats. These are gone from YAML 1.2, and were
    actually never supported by this package as it's clearly a poor choice.
 .
 and offers backwards compatibility with YAML 1.1 in some cases. 1.2,
 including support for anchors, tags, map merging, etc. Multi-document
 unmarshalling is not yet implemented, and base-60 floats from YAML 1.1 are
 purposefully not supported since they're a poor design and are gone in YAML
 1.2.

Package: gpsprune
Description-md5: 4cd2b69a33c05e4615249da27b877da9
Description-en: visualize, edit, convert and prune GPS data
 GpsPrune is an application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate
 data from GPS systems. It's a tool for preparing GPS data before you go on a
 trip, and for playing with your collected GPS data after you get home again.
 .
 It can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any
 tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS
 receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap
 images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete
 points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data
 (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX
 file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS
 receiver.
 .
 Some example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting
 wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It
 can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from
 various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to
 analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.
 .
 Furthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and
 lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions.
 You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a
 nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or
 speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the
 EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that
 they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have
 coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or
 automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write
 these coordinates into the EXIF tags.

Package: hedgewars
Description-md5: 95a283ed5766101c57cbbde0d1b67a66
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

 scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate for high
 latency scenarios where raw data throughput is less important than the ability
 to handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in a resource efficient
 manner.

Package: inotify-tools
Description-md5: e618c4a03d6d9bd64a85dac1a2e53ff3
Description-en: command-line programs providing a simple interface to inotify
 inotify (inode notify) is a Linux kernel subsystem that monitors events in
 filesystems and reports those events to applications in real time via API.
 .
 inotify can be used to monitor individual files or directories. When a
 directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the directory itself
 and for files inside the directory.
 .
 inotify-tools is a set of command-line programs for Linux providing a simple
 interface to inotify. These programs can be used to monitor and act upon
 filesystem events. inotify-tools consists of four utilities: inotifywait,
 inotifywatch, fsnotifywait and fsnotifywatch.
 .
 inotifywait efficiently waits for changes to files, making it appropriate
 for use in shell scripts.
 .
 inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts of each
 inotify event.
 .
 fsnotifywait and fsnotifywatch are similar to inotifywait and inotifywatch,
 but they are using Linux's fanotify(7) interface by default. The fanotify API
 also provides notification and interception of filesystem events. Additional
 capabilities compared to the inotify(7) API include the ability to monitor
 all of the objects in a mounted filesystem, the ability to make access
 permission decisions, and the possibility to read or modify files before
 access by other applications.
 .
 inotify-tools is also useful for security activities in firewall systems or
 to detect changes and injections of new files in webservers by intruders.

Description-md5: 1afe17066f5e5c2e1de7cf8ea89474f9
Description-en: simple top-like I/O monitor (implemented in C)
 iotop-c does for I/O usage what top(1) does for CPU usage. It watches I/O
 usage information output by the Linux kernel and displays a table of
 current I/O usage by processes on the system. It is handy for answering
 the question "Why is the disk churning so much?".
 .
 iotop-c requires a Linux kernel built with the CONFIG_TASKSTATS,
 CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT, CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING and
 CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS config options on.

    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
    _during_ a conversation, correspondents are assured the messages
    they see are authentic and unmodified.
  * Forward secrecy - if you lose control of your private keys,
    no previous conversation is compromised.

Package: jdupes
Description-md5: c39c2d10a5bfd8aedad8944d3ef07d4f
Description-en: identify and delete or link duplicate files
 jdupes is a program based in fdupes. The main goal of jdupes is identify
 and taking actions upon duplicate files. In comparison with fdupes, jdupes
 is heavily modified from and improved.
 .
 The biggest reason to use jdupes is raw speed. In testing on various data
 sets, jdupes is over 7 times faster than fdupes-1.51 on average.
 .
 Code in jdupes is written with data loss avoidance as the highest priority.
 If a choice must be made between being aggressive or careful, the careful
 way is always chosen.
 .
 jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of such
 features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over which
 file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted. jdupes is not
 afraid of dropping features of low value; a prime example is the -1 switch
 which outputs all matches in a set on one line, a feature which was found
 to be useless in real-world tests and therefore thrown out.
 .
 jdupes can convert duplicate files in hardlinks or relative softlinks. It
 is useful in several scenarios, as in Debian packaging, to create relative
 symlinks to lots of duplicate files (it will substitute rdfind + symlinks
 commands, used to same purpose, when solving lintian duplicate-files).
 .
 Packages build for Linux versions have support to btrfs filesystem.

Description-en: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Package: lib2geom1.2.0
Description-md5: 59df32d7ca736f20480217b53a32e7ae
Description-en: robust computational geometry framework -- shared library
 2Geom is a C++ 2D geometry library geared towards robust processing of
 computational geometry data associated with vector graphics. The primary
 design consideration is ease of use and clarity. It is dual-licensed
 under LGPL 2.1 and MPL 1.1.
 .
 The library is descended from a set of geometric routines present in
 Inkscape, a vector graphics editor based around the Scalable Vector
 Graphics format, the most widespread vector graphics interchange format
 on the Web and a W3C Recommendation. Due to this legacy, not all parts
 of the API form a coherent whole (yet).

 rdiff is a little like diff and patch all rolled into one, with support for
 binary files. Since it takes advantage of the rsync remote-delta algorithm, you
 do not need the source file in the same place as your destination file.
 .
 To use it, you generate a "signature" of the original file and copy the
 signature (which is very small) to the same location as the modified file. Then
 you generate a "delta" which describes the changes required to turn the source
 file into the modified file. The small delta file can then be used to "patch"
 the original file, to transform it into the modified file.

 is only working on systems that boot from Android-capable bootloaders.
 And usually there will be a partition called misc, which is the BCB
 partition.
 .
 For example, if you debootstrap or install Debian on AOSP's system
 partition, then you can use this util to control the bootloader's boot
 behaviour. Such as to boot to recovery on the next boot.

Package: usbip
Description-md5: 84110e083527a27b37417dcab69e5ab7
Description-en: USB device sharing system over IP network
 USB/IP is a system for sharing USB devices over the network.
 .
 To share USB devices between computers with their full functionality,
 USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP packets and transmits them
 between computers.
 .
 Original USB device drivers and applications can be used for remote USB
 devices without any modification of them.  A computer can use remote USB
 devices as if they were directly attached.
 .
 Currently USB/IP provides no access control or encryption.  It should only
 be used in trusted environments.
 .
 This package provides the server component 'usbipd' and the client tool
 'usbip'.

Description-en: ncurses-based log file viewer
 The log file navigator, lnav, is an enhanced log file viewer that
 takes advantage of any semantic information that can be gleaned from
 the files being viewed, such as timestamps and log levels.  Using this
 extra semantic information, lnav can do things like interleaving
 messages from different files, generate histograms of messages over
 time, and providing hotkeys for navigating through the file.  It is
 hoped that these features will allow the user to quickly and
 efficiently zero in on problems.

 it's aware of for data, which it in turn will use to create graphs and HTML
 pages, suitable for viewing with your graphical web browser of choice.
 .
 It is also able to alert you if any value is outside of a preset boundary,
 useful if you want to be alerted if a filesystem is about to grow full, for
 instance.  You can do this by making Munin run an arbitrary command when you
 need to be alert it, or make use of the intrinsic Nagios support.

Package: musescore-general-soundfont
Description-md5: dc11af2901acb0a8778de9a541753040
Description-en: General SoundFont from MuseScore (HQ version, lossy)
 This is the HQ version for the new standard hard disc space-saving
 SF3 format soundfont as shipped with MuseScore 2.2 and newer.
 .
 This release of the soundfont supports Single-Note Dynamics with
 MuseScore 3.2 and higher.
 .
 MuseScore_General_HQ aims at providing the best audio quality and
 soundfont programming features, while being a compatible drop-in
 replacement for the less heavyweight MuseScore_General soundfont,
 providing the complete GM (General MIDI) sound set, with separate
 ensemble samples for several instruments, and some extras.
 .
 It can be used with most modern MIDI synthesisers which support
 the SF3 format, although early implementations (such as the one
 from MuseScore before release 2.2) had bugs making the resulting
 sound bad; instead use fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont for those.
 .
 As it comes under the MIT licence, it can be used in most settings,
 but do remember that waveforms generated using this soundfont are
 “copies or substantial portions of the” soundfont. It is sufficient
 to reproduce the licence and copyright notice in any “associated
 documentation files” provided with your generated waveforms.
 .
 The musescore-general-soundfont-small package contains the normal
 soundfont (as shipped with MuseScore 3.x), lossily SF3 compressed.
 The musescore-general-soundfont package similarly provides the
 HQ version of the soundfont (with separate ensembles instruments
 and other large improvements) as SF3, whereas the SF2 HQ version
 is packaged as musescore-general-soundfont-lossless for use with
 synthesisers lacking SF3 support, by audiophiles, and to avoid
 long MuseScore startup times; however with a large disc footprint.
 .
 This package will be installed into /usr/share/sounds/sf3/ which
 is the standard Debian location for system-wide SF3 soundfonts.

Package: musescore-general-soundfont-lossless
Description-md5: e44e21b53d77da0fc50d29eece86e66e
Description-en: General SoundFont from MuseScore (uncompressed)
 This is the HQ version for the new standard soundfont of MuseScore 2.2
 and newer, in uncompressed SF2 format. It has a significantly larger
 disc footprint than its corresponding SF3, but is identical other than
 not compressing the samples with a lossy algorithm. This avoids audible
 Vorbis artefacts and the excessively long MuseScore startup time with
 compressed soundfonts and can be used by SF3-incompatible synthesisers.
 .
 This release of the soundfont supports Single-Note Dynamics with
 MuseScore 3.2 and higher.
 .
 MuseScore_General_HQ aims at providing the best audio quality and
 soundfont programming features, while being a compatible drop-in
 replacement for the less heavyweight MuseScore_General soundfont,
 providing the complete GM (General MIDI) sound set, with separate
 ensemble samples for several instruments, and some extras.
 .
 It can be used with almost all MIDI synthesisers (with SoundFont 2.01
 support) although bugs in early implementations (e.g. MuseScore before
 version 2.2) cause sound degradation. (Install fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont
 which has a compatible instrument assignment for those it supports.)
 .
 As it comes under the MIT licence, it can be used in most settings,
 but do remember that waveforms generated using this soundfont are
 “copies or substantial portions of the” soundfont. It is sufficient
 to reproduce the licence and copyright notice in any “associated
 documentation files” provided with your generated waveforms.

Description-en: General SoundFont from MuseScore (lossy)
 This is the new standard hard disc space-saving SF3 format
 soundfont as shipped with MuseScore 2.2 and newer.
 .
 This release of the soundfont supports Single-Note Dynamics with
 MuseScore 3.2 and higher.
 .
 MuseScore_General attempts to keep the installed-size footprint
 low while providing the complete GM (General MIDI) sound set
 and some extras; were it not for the new pianos, it would even
 be smaller than its antecessor fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont despite
 restoring stereo samples for some instruments and the new focus
 on quality, thanks to numerous optimisations and bugfixes.
 .
 It can be used with most modern MIDI synthesisers which support
 the SF3 format, although early implementations (such as the one
 from MuseScore before release 2.2) had bugs making the resulting
 sound bad; instead use fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont for those.

Package: musescore3
Description-md5: 918a5b607328a5b68af7afb28d12c052
Description-en: cross-platform multi-lingual music composition and notation, v3
 MuseScore is an Open Source (GNU GPL) music notation software that runs
 on all platforms supported by Qt5 (GNU/Linux, MacOS X, Windows), and is
 available in over forty different languages. It features an easy to use
 WYSIWYG editor with audio score playback for results that look and sound
 beautiful, rivaling commercial offerings like Finale and Sibelius.
 .
 This package provides MuseScore 3. You can install multiple versions of
 MuseScore in parallel, and upstream recommends doing so, because each
 major version has a new, incompatible, layout engine, and changing old
 scores without relayouting them fully with the new version can only be
 done by the old version. For MuseScore 2, install the musescore package,
 and expect a musescore4 package to show up in Debian bookworm.
 .

 .
 Most elements in MuseScore are laid out automatically on a “virtual note
 sheet”, with a near professional-quality layout engine, but can also be
 positioned manually, giving you total control of every score element’s
 position. The capabilities of MuseScore can be extended via plugins and
 extensions, and the growing repository on musescore.org contains many
 plugins submitted by users and an active development team.
 .
 MuseScore includes a set of sounds that reproduce common instruments (as
 defined by General MIDI) without taking up a lot of disk space or memory
 providing full orchestral and band sounds (with the Drumline extension
 installed this includes marching percussion). The general (non-Drumline)
 sound font is available as musescore-general-soundfont Debian package,
 if you wish to reuse it with other synthesisers.) You can also load any
 sound font you prefer for a wider variety of sounds or for more realism.
 .
 MuseScore can import and export MIDI and MusicXML files, and it can also
 import from Capella and several other programs. MuseScore can export to
 PDF, PNG, and other graphic formats, to WAV and other audio formats such
 as OGG Vorbis and MP3, or to GNU Lilypond for an alternative layout and
 print option.
 .
 MuseScore can upload scores to musescore.com, a score sharing site, and
 send scrolling sheet music videos to YouTube. In addition to the desktop
 software, you can rehearse “on the go” with MuseScore mobile apps (which
 do not support note entry, but many advanced playback functions). Note
 that all of these are commercial or otherwise non-free offers optionally
 integrated with, but not part of, the Free notation program. Scrolling
 video scores feature the notes highlighted in the score as they sound —
 and highlighted on a virtual piano keyboard below.

Description-en: next generation suite of BLAST sequence search tools
 The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the most widely
 used sequence similarity tool. There are versions of BLAST that
 compare protein queries to protein databases, nucleotide queries
 to nucleotide databases, as well as versions that translate nucleotide
 queries or databases in all six frames and compare to protein databases
 or queries.
 PSI-BLAST produces a position-specific-scoring-matrix (PSSM) starting
 with a protein query, and then uses that PSSM to perform further searches.
 It is also possible to compare a protein or nucleotide query to a
 database of PSSM’s.
 The NCBI supports a BLAST web page at blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as well as
 a network service.

 OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a
 secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the OpenConnect
 SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with
 clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The OpenConnect VPN protocol
 uses the standard IETF security protocols such as TLS 1.2, and Datagram TLS to
 provide the secure VPN service. The server is implemented primarily for the
 GNU/Linux platform but its code is designed to be portable to other UNIX
 variants as well.
 .
 Ocserv's main feature is isolation of the VPN users from the main VPN server
 process. Each authenticated user is assigned an unprivileged worker process,
 and a networking (tun) device. That not only eases the control of the resources
 of each user or group of users, but also prevents privilege escalation due to
 any bug on the VPN handling (worker) server. Each VPN user can be authenticated
 using password, PAM, public key (in a smart card or not) or any combination of
 methods.

   - oidc-agent that handles communication with the OIDC provider
   - oidc-gen that generates config files
   - oidc-add that loads (and unloads) configuration into the agent
   - oidc-token that can be used to get access token on the command line

 cross-entropy rate of the model versus the actual process. PPM, prediction by
 partial matching, is an adaptive statistical model of a symbol sequence which
 models the likelihood of the next byte based on a (relatively short) suffix of
 the sequence of previous bytes.

Package: pcapfix
Description-md5: ca1894e2a9b74596f788a20d3c631a6a
Description-en: repairs broken pcap and pcapng files
 libpcap (Packet CAPture) provides a portable framework for low-level network
 monitoring. Network dumps based on libpcap can be made by tcpdump, wireshark
 and other tools. Sometimes those dumps can get corrupted by several reasons.
 Examples of this are a copy from Linux to Windows with a conversion to DOS/
 Windows text file line ending (CR-LF) or a transfer over FTP in ASCII mode
 instead of BINARY mode.
 .
 pcapfix tries to repair your broken pcap files, fixing the global header and
 recovering the packets by searching and guessing the packet headers.
 .
 pcapfix will first step through the packets top down until it recognizes a
 corrupted one by using plausibility checks. After that the tool will brute
 force further pcap packet headers by reading the file byte by byte. If another
 proper packet is found, pcapfix restores the data in between by adding a
 well-formed pcap packet header.
 .
 The PCAP Next Generation Dump File Format (or pcapng for short) is an attempt
 to overcome the limitations of the currently widely used (but limited) libpcap
 format. Since 1.0.0 version, pcapfix works with pcapng format too.

 This is helpful when you need a single identifier to reference different
 classes of objects, for example in job scheduling, when one needs to reference
 a model object rather than serialize the object itself. Another example is a
 drop-down list of options, consisting of both Users and Groups. One has then a
 universal identifier that works for objects of both classes.

Description-en: Simple mime type detection
 Marcel attempts to choose the most appropriate content type for a given file
 by looking at the binary data, the filename, and any declared type (perhaps
 passed as a request header).
 .
 By preference, the magic number data in any passed in file is used to determine
 the type. If this doesn't work, it uses the type gleaned from the filename,
 extension, and finally the declared type. If no valid type is found in any of
 these, "application/octet-stream" is returned.
 .
 Some types aren't easily recognised solely by magic number data. For example
 Adobe Illustrator files have the same magic number as PDFs (and can usually
 even be viewed in PDF viewers!). For these types, Marcel uses both the magic
 number data and the file name to work out the type.

    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-en: library for stochastic optimization problems (development package)
 The STochastic OPTimization library (StOpt) aims at providing tools in C++ for
 solving some stochastic optimization problems encountered in finance or in the
 industry. Different methods are available:
  - dynamic programming methods based on Monte Carlo with regressions (global,
  local, kernel and sparse regressors), for underlying states following some
  uncontrolled Stochastic Differential Equations;
  - dynamic programming with a representation of uncertainties with a tree:
  transition problems are here solved by some discretizations of the commands,
  resolution of LP with cut representation of the Bellman values;
  - Semi-Lagrangian methods for Hamilton Jacobi Bellman general equations for
  underlying states following some controlled Stochastic Differential
  Equations;
  - Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming methods to deal with stochastic stock
  management problems in high dimension. Uncertainties can be given by Monte
  Carlo and can be represented by a state with a finite number of values
  (tree);
  - Some branching nesting methods to solve very high dimensional non linear
  PDEs and some appearing in HJB problems. Besides some methods are provided
  to solve by Monte Carlo some problems where the underlying stochastic state
  is controlled.
  For each method, a framework is provided to optimize the problem and then
  simulate it out of the sample using the optimal commands previously computed.
  Parallelization methods based on OpenMP and MPI are provided in this
  framework permitting to solve high dimensional problems on clusters.
 The library should be flexible enough to be used at different levels depending
 on the user's willingness.
 .
 This package contains the headers and the static libraries (libstopt-mpi
 which allows for multithreading, and libstopt which does not).

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: xdg-desktop-portal
Description-md5: 7eac259f6a9a24c9e234ad737a8c6945
Description-en: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.

 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.

Description-en: downloader of videos from YouTube and other sites
 yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork based on the now inactive youtube-dlc.
 The main focus of this project is adding new features and patches
 while also keeping up to date with the original project.
 .
 yt-dlp is a small command-line program to download videos from
 YouTube.com and other sites that don't provide direct links to the
 videos served.
 .
 yt-dlp allows the user, among other things, to choose a specific video
 quality to download (if available) or let the program automatically
 determine the best (or worst) quality video to grab. It supports
 downloading entire playlists and all videos from a given user.
 .
 Currently supported sites (or features of sites) are:
